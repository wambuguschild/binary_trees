1. What is a binary tree
2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
